        question: 'What is a precast RCC boundary wall, and how is it made?',
        answer:
            'A precast RCC (Reinforced Cement Concrete) boundary wall consists of factory-made concrete panels and prestressed posts. Manufactured under strict quality control using high-tensile steel strands and high-grade concrete, these components are transported to your site and assembled using an interlocking slot system.',
    },
    {
        question: 'How fast can a precast boundary wall be installed on-site?',
        answer:
            'On average, our team can install 100 to 200 running feet of precast wall per day depending on ground conditions. This makes installation up to 50% faster than traditional brick-and-mortar masonry walls.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Are precast RCC walls cheaper than traditional brick walls?',
        answer:
            'Yes, precast concrete walls save up to 30% to 40% on total project costs. Savings come from reduced site labor requirements, zero raw material wastage (sand, brick, water), and faster completion times without needing continuous plastering.',
    },
    {
        question: 'How durable are these walls against extreme weather and moisture?',
        answer:
            'Precast RCC panels are highly resistant to heavy monsoon rains, severe summer heat, freeze-thaw cycles, and soil moisture. Because they are cast with high-density concrete, they do not crack, rot, or absorb water like conventional brick walls.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Can precast walls be relocated or dismantled later?',
        answer:
            'Yes! One of the biggest advantages of our modular precast system is that the panels and posts can be safely uninstalled, transported, and re-erected if your land boundaries or site layout plans change in the future.',
    },
    {
        question: 'Which areas do you supply and service?',
        answer:
            'We manufacture and deliver across Rajasthan and Delhi NCR, with major service hubs near our factory units in Alwar, Bhiwadi, Gurugram, Faridabad, and surrounding industrial zones.',
    },
